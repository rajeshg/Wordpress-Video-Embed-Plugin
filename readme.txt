MyVideo: 
- every occurence of the expression [myvideo id width height] (case unsensitive) will start as
an embedded flash player. Replace "id" with the MyVideo id. For the URL 
http://www.myvideo.de/watch/366128, the id part is 366128

The default width and height is definded in "define("YOUTUBE_WIDTH", 425)" and
"define("YOUTUBE_HEIGHT", 350)". To change the default size, simply edit the
values. Additionally you can add the desired width and height to the expression
seperated by spaces (i.e. [youtube id 300 150].

For the URL http://youtube.com/watch?v=83FWE_qBudU, the id part is 83FWE_qBudU,

the default dimensions "[youtube 83FWE_qBudU 210 175]"

seperated by spaces (i.e. [dailymotion id 300 150].

For the URL http://dailymotion.com/video/xbxov2_hello-geekette, the id part is xbxov2,
so a valid tag would be "[dailymotion xbxov2]" or even "[dailymotion http://dailymotion.com/video/xbxov2_hello-geekette]
